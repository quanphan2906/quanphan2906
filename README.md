Hi there ğŸ‘‹ I'm Quan Phan, hailing from Viet Nam. I'm currently a first-year undergraduate :man_student: at Colby College.

Iâ€™m super interested in the applications of Machine Learning and Data Science beyond the business industry ğŸ‘€. 

I'm ramping up the necessary skills for a Data Scientist ğŸŒ±, so feel free to reach out if you want to join.

Anyhow, have a nice day! ğŸ¤Ÿ
