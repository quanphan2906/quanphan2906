Hi there ğŸ‘‹ I'm Quan Phan, hailing from Viet Nam. I'm currently a second-year undergraduate at Colby College :man_student: and a data analyst/product management intern @ Holistics Data.

Iâ€™m super interested in Machine Learning and Data Science in Agriculture and Environmental Science ğŸ‘€

I'm always working to improve my data science skills ğŸŒ±, so feel free to reach out if you want to join me ğŸ’»

Anyhow, have a nice day! ğŸ¤Ÿ
