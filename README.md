Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm a software engineer with a product mind. Last three summers, I've building at two different SaaS startups as a full-stack swe and product intern. My favorite tech is Typescript and React.js, although I can work across the web stack and am familiar with basic ML & data engineering.

Big fan of Notion and Obsidian. You can check out my newest work:

Please reach out if you want to chat startups, product, the web stack. Have a nice day! ðŸ¤Ÿ
